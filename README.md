## 1. Introduction.

When you see the word “Romance” in regard to languages, think “Romans,” as in the ancient Roman people who spoke Latin. The 35 modern Romance languages that are considered living languages, including Spanish and Italian, are descended from the Vulgar Latin. “Vulgar” in this case means “common or everyday.” Vulgar Latin was the language of the common people, as opposed to the written Latin language used by scholars and the aristocratic class, which was called Classical Latin.<br /><br />

The Roman Empire broke apart starting around the 5th century C.E. Between the 6th and 9th centuries C.E., the independent countries that developed from the former Roman Empire began to develop the individual Romance languages that became the ancestor-languages of the modern Romance languages. These modern languages include Catalan (spoken in the region of northern Spain around Barcelona), French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian.

Although both Italian and Spanish are Romance languages, they are classified as belonging to different sub-families. Both belong to the same Italo-Western branch of Romance languages that also includes French and Portuguese. Then the Itero-Western branch splits off into the Proto-Italian branch, which includes the “main” Italian language and Italy’s regional dialects such as Sicilian and Venetian, and the Western Romance branch proper, which includes Spanish, Spain’s regional dialects, French, France’s regional dialects, and Portuguese.

Of all the Romance languages, Spanish and Italian are considered two of the most “conservative,” a term used in this case to mean that the language’s characteristics remain close to the characteristics of Vulgar Latin. Italy’s Sardinian dialect is considered by linguists to be the closest living language to Vulgar Latin.
